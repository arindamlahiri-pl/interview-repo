## VS Code Configuration

If you're using VS Code, the repository includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file. This file ensures that:

- Code is automatically formatted on save.
- ESLint fixes are applied on save.
- Prettier is used as the default formatter for TypeScript files.

You are also recommended to install the following VS Code extensions:

- ESLint (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)

VS Code will prompt you to install these extensions when you open the repository.
